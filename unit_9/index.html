					<h3>FAQ</h3>
					<hr>
					<div class="question">
						<p class="questiontitle">What sets your product apart from your competitors?</p>
						<p class="questionanswer">Before our product is packaged and shipped, it is bathed in a vat of arsenic and formaldehyde to ensure only the most sterile end product, and after drying, small amounts of Uranium-238 are added to the mixture to prevent bacterial growth after the shipment has left our factory.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<p class="questiontitle">Is it true that asbestos can be dangerous to human health?</p>
						<p class="questionanswer">Of course not. The first to suggest this theory was a man named 'Pliny the Elder' in 79 AD, however he also belived that inserting garlic in his anus cured his hemorrhoids and that rubbing feaces on his head would cure his baldness, and he died inhaling volcanic gas when he decided to enter Pompei AFTER he'd seen Mt. Vesuvius erupt from a safe distance. Are you really going to take that guy's word for it?</p>
					</div>
					<div class="question">
						<p class="questiontitle">Where can I learn more about asbestos?</p>
						<p class="questionanswer">Everything you need to know about asbestos is right here on this website. There is a lot of misinformation about our product floating around the internet, but you can safely ignore any claims that asbestos is dangerous in any way.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="question">
						<p class="questiontitle">Where do you mine your asbestos?</p>
						<p class="questionanswer">Our asbestos is harvested from only the finest mines in Central Zimbabwe, and we are glad to boast we currently hold the greatest safety standards of any mine in the region with only 480 fatalities occuring in our facilities over the past year.</p>

							<p class="reviewtext">I have been buying my asbestos from Goodwill for the past 25 years, and could not speak more highly of them. My only complaint is that an entirely unrelated terminal lung disease I contracted last year will eventually prevent me from continuing to purchase more of this product.</p>
